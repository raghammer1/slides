1. Added a search button for user to search the presentation
2. Re-arrange slides also shows the slide preview
3. UI usability, presentation title was not visible when user added a thumbnail hence title color is black when thumbnail is added and white when not
4. Also to lower the issue the presentation card tile will flip to show the details of slide number, title and description
5. Used ZuStand instead of React-Redux to learn the new and upcoming technology
