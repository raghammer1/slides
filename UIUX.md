1. Consistency: We have consistency in our design meaning that similar elements behave in similar ways, which reduces learning time and confusion. This includes consistent navigation, color schemes, font styles, button shapes, and overall layout.
2. Simplicity: We have minimized the cognitive load on users by eliminating unnecessary elements or content that doesnâ€™t support user tasks, for example we have added border on each textbox while user in editing stage for user understandability and it is later removed when user in presentation.
3. Visibility: We have ensured that everything is easily visible to the user, for example we have used flip animation so that the font color of the presentation thumbnail doesn't get hidden due to the image on the thumbnail and hence rendering it unreadable.
4. Feedback: Every action that a user takes on the app have some feedback, for example when user adds or deletes a slide there is an instant alert message saying successfully deleted or added a slide.
5. Conservation of Energy: Our interface reduces the amount of effort users need to put in to complete tasks. for example whenever adding a new element there is one edit button from where all slide display actions can be handled and all properties related to that element can be set in the same modal and things like percentages are displayed using range scrolls so that user can't input a value larger than 100 or lower than 0
6. Wording: All the components and buttons in the app have been named with extreme thinking meaning a button says what it does and it does that.
7. Familiarity: We have used design patterns that users are used to and understand already, meaning for example to change the title or properties of a presentation user hovers over the title and it underline showing intractability
